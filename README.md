# EDMC Route Planner Plugin

This plugin is for the [EDMarketConnector (EDMC)](https://github.com/EDCD/EDMarketConnector).
It can be used to load a route from a CSV file (e.g. from [Spansh](https://spansh.co.uk/)) or
by loading faction systems that are outdated by more than a given number of hours.

The plugin places the next system in route into the clipboard, so it can be easily copied via
CTRL+V in the galaxy map or by macros. Once the system is reached the next system will be placed
into the clipboard and so on.
